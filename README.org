At first running of make, it didn't compile completely. Makefile was adjusted to compile everything with "make".
Program itself did not return anything correct.

* Extra unecessary files were removed.
* Changed unindenting program to getline instead of >>, to delimit on new lines.
* Corrected methods inside while. Added a break since no helper was used to move loop forward.
